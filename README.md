# Decoding Encoded Text with Genetic Algorithms

This project aims to decode encoded text using a **Genetic Algorithm**. The algorithm generates a population of candidate keys and employs crossover and mutation operations to enhance them, ultimately revealing the decoded text.

## Genetic Algorithm Overview

A **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** is a powerful optimization technique inspired by natural selection. It constructs and evolves a population of potential solutions by utilizing genetic operators such as mutation and crossover to identify the most suitable solution.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project include:

1. **Defining Genetic Algorithm Terms:**
   - Clearly defining essential terms such as **Gene**, **Chromosome**, and **Fitness Function** within the context of text decoding.

2. **Initial Population Generation:**
   - Creating the initial population of candidate keys, where each key represents a possible decryption key.

3. **Fitness Function:**
   - Defining and implementing a **Fitness Function** to evaluate the fitness of potential decryption keys based on their effectiveness in decoding the text.

4. **Crossover and Mutation:**
   - Implementing the **Crossover** and **Mutation** processes to evolve and refine the decryption keys within the population.

5. **Algorithm Execution:**
   - Executing the genetic algorithm to proficiently decode the encoded text.

By accomplishing these goals, this project aims to showcase the effectiveness of Genetic Algorithms in successfully decoding encoded text using a 14-letter key.
